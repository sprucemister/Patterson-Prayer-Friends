8 months in Japan has flown by. Recently, we celebrated Stewart obtaining a drivers license by taking a mini road trip further out of the city into saitama (our prefecture) the boys enjoyed a car ride and we learned how toll roads work. We had かき氷 at a strawberry farm and looked at a nearby lake.

Stewart's job is picking up (it seemed a slow start at first) and we are all adjusting to not having him around as much (insert more here if you want)

I (Emma) will be finishing up her second semester of language school. I am getting a good foundational basis for Japanese, so it seems time to move towards independent study. I've had times where language miscommunication is just hard, painful, and repetitive. But I was encouraged the other day as the おばあさん　of the neighborhood spoke with me and I understood what they were saying. I've reached out to other believers, classmates and of course Stewart about my frustrations and I received a lot of encouragement and wisdom. I'm thankful for that.

Judah is enjoying kindergarten. His teacher says he speaks more Japanese every day and is playing well with the other kiddos. We are thankful for this and thankful for such helpful staff at the school!

As we look towards the year we hope and pray we can visit other missionaries in Japan. We have a goal to meet with others and explore what they are doing in Japan. This we hope will help us discern what we would enjoy doing in Japan.

Please pray - For a reasonably priced car that we can purchase soon so we can make that happen.

-   Stewart's friendships outside of work and within the working world. He works with many nationalities as well as Japanese people.

-   Emma has new friendships- please pray for these interactions as well.

-   We've had difficulty finding part time childcare for Solomon. Please pray we can find the right place or person for him.

-   We really want to stay focused on our goals and enjoy the present time. Please pray for our hearts to be at peace in the busyness as well as when it's slow.

-   Adjustment is an ebb and flow process. Please pray for our continued adjustment to Japan.
