Christmas time is here!

Hey guys! Wanted to give you an update.
We are waiting for Stewart's work visa to be approved by the government. We are praying it gets done by January 4th, so he can begin his new job.
Language school is going swimmingly for me! Praise God, we found a school that offered both virtual and in-person! About once every two weeks I go to the school. Truly, this was an answered prayer as we really were wanting a hybrid option.
I've been trying ballet at a studio close to the train station. It's been fun trying something totally new to me. The class is in Japanese of course, but no better time to practice my listening skills.
The other day, the instrumental version of "*The First Noel*" played during class. I became teary, because I was the only one in the class (that I know of) that knows the words to that song and more importantly, the significance. 

You see Christmas trees and Santa Claus at many train stations and hear carols from the overhead speakers in the grocery store.
I heard someone recently say "Santa Claus brings us hope during Christmas" As an outsider and Christian, it feels hollow.  
During Christmas time this year, I feel I'm aware of a treasure that fewer people know about:


*"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.*

45 â€œ*Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. 46 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it*- Matthew 13:44-46

At night, we turn on our Christmas tree lights on and listen to Christmas songs about Jesus. And it's such a sweet time.

Jesus' light shines still in places where He is not known. And personally, I am finding that I treasure His light currently being surrounded by more spiritual darkness.

Thank you for your prayers. We appreciate them so much. 

**Please pray:**

  - The work visa to go through
  - For the women in my ballet class
  - For my language abilities to continue to improve!
  - Our hearts are sad to not be close to our families during this time of year
