Quick update from the Pattersons to say that we arrived in Japan yesterday! 
Planes aren't designed for our rambunctious boys but by God's grace we all had
enough patience to get along well enough to get here in one piece with all 15 
pieces of checked luggage arriving as well.

Thankful for gracious friends putting us up for the night before leaving in America
and for friends picking us up in Japan and helping us get settled.

The hardest part so far has been several hard goodbyes over the last few weeks 
to all our friends and family that we have loved and been close too, but
we're super glad and excited to be hear after years of wanting to go.

Thank you all for your prayers and check out these photos from our last few days.
