It has been too long! I'm writing this as I sit on a packed train. Overheard talk from at least three languages at the moment. Japanese trains are known for being quiet, but Saturday nights are refreshingly laid back and friends chat freely. Most people are dressed up. Some still sleep among the noise. Recently, a person jumped in front of a train while my friend was on-board. This unfortunately happens frequently. Please pray for the people of Japan. This grieves us. 

Stewart has now transitioned into a new job It can be challenging to lay boundaries around excessive work, commuting and other demands- but he is handling it with grace and honesty. The company is willing to work with these requests and we are grateful for that. 

Adjusting to the city (outside of the big big city) has been challenging. I (Emma) have struggled with social anxiety the past months. Impromptu conversations at the park made me feel like crawling in a hole. Confusion about some form at the kindergarten would make my chest go tight. Afterwards, I would feel shame for not being able to communicate well. I struggled to look people in the eye, or just not be hurried.  However, I've recently felt significant breakthrough in this area. I realized this one day when Judah was playing with a child at the park. I didn’t feel anxiety about if I was doing the right thing. I was available and open for conversation and we had a nice chat. I was also open to a conflict or an issue arising, understanding that would not be the end of the world. God is the true giver of earnest peace (Jeremiah 6:14) and He is who defines us, not others opinions. Praise God from whom all blessings flow. I can embrace who I am today because of who He is always (put that on a shirt, amiright?)

Our neighbor friends from the middle east come by regularly to drop off food or play. I love that they feel comfortable and welcome to do this. I pray that Jesus touches them as they are not yet Jesus followers. 

I (Emma) have also made more connections with Japanese believers and nonbelievers. These relationships are so treasured. I will be going with my Japanese mom friend to a Halloween party soon. Please pray for Japanese believers as they have unique challenges and experiences here. Please pray for the Japanese to encounter the authentic and loving relationship of Jesus. 

Currently we are praying abot where to live. Our current home is tiiight (about 90 square meters) and we need a parking spot for our car (but also-yay, we have a car!) At first, we felt the move might be more significant, to another city maybe.  At the moment, we feel progressive peace about staying near this area. There is a lot to consider: Judah's upcoming move to elementary school, kindergarten for Solomon, accessibility to work for Stewart and proximity to church community. We are continuing to pray about this. 

Counseling is part of our week now, as we work through the significant challenges of being married. We are so thankful to have found a counselor who is helping us along the way. I am also reflecting on the dear friendships I have right now that I didn’t have a few months ago—deeply thankful.
