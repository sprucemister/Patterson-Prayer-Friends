We have been in Japan for a month plus some! Holy cow, how your life can change so much. 
Judah started kindergarten(yochien). He’s mostly excited about the hat he gets to wear and the class rabbit. Please pray for him as he starts this new adventure! 
He looks so proud telling me Japanese words that he’s learned throughout the day. The new word yesterday was “nemui” which means sleepy. 
There are so many things we’ve had to get set up: registering at city hall, Japanese bank account, health insurance….it’s a lot of paperwork. And Japan especially loves paperwork. Stewart often traverses this maize himself, but when he’s had questions we have friends to turn to. Very thankful for that! 
We moved into our rental house! Initially we had issues with electricity and air con…but the electricity has been increased and we have an air con solution. Honestly, being in the heat really challenged me mentally as well as physically.

Some sweet moments in the mornings have happened with the kids. They wake a little earlier now, and often come in when I’m having my quiet time. I’ve learned this is a great opportunity to speak to them about what I’m reading in the Bible. The other day J and I had a conversation about the fruits of the spirit. What I viewed as a hindrance initially has turned out to be a gospel opportunity. 

Sometimes (a lot of the times) I feel naive. One night I walked down a reflective Tokyo street in the rain, past flower shops and apartments. I thought to myself “I love the newness of this experience” followed by “no no no just wait until you get tired of it”

Satan or not, we know we are in the honeymoon phase of moving overseas. And I feel the need to brace myself or downplay my excitement. Well that’s silly. It’s a new experience and yes thank you I am excited to be here. 
I can walk down one street and see rows of crops unknown to me. The next it’s busy with people riding their bikes in all directions. Then I can turn again and admire someone’s beautiful flower garden.  Let’s not lose the joy of the moment to a future that’s unknown to us. 

Please pray with us as we discern a language school for me to attend. I have the option of virtual or in person. In person means I’ll have a commute. Virtual means I’ll stay nearby in our city, Niiza. I see benefits to both. I’m praying for direction
