There are hints of fall coming around the corner, but currently it’s still pretty hot. We are looking forward to the cooler weather. Solomon just celebrated his 4th birthday! We are so thankful for our littlest crew member — he says the funniest and sweetest things, loves giving hugs and doing pretty much everything big brother does. What a blessing he is. 

### Summer Recap

We spent lots of time at the river near our house this summer! 

A last minute decision was made that I would go back to the states this summer with the boys. It was a good time to rest and enjoy being back in the home culture. This trip was grounding and helped give clarity on hopes and goals for the next year. Due to the last minute nature of the decision and that I was traveling with the two boys solo, unfortunately we couldn’t visit everyone we’d hoped to visit. We thank you for your understanding— and appreciate your prayers as we continue to work through the challenges of managing return visits.

I’m celebrating some wins this week as I reflect back on our summer. We have figured out some healthier home routines that work better for us. We can anticipate the busier times of the year and the less busy times. We’ve scheduled more times of rest for the upcoming fall. Moving around the city has become easier as well as they boys are older and we're out of the stroller stage. Going back to the states and then returning back to Japan highlighted to me actually how far we have come in the past two years— something I couldn’t see prior to the trip to the states. 

Recently, Stewart attended our church's mens' retreat for the weekend. It was a good time of  fellowship, rest and getting to know the other men in our church, many of whom have been living and working here for much longer than us. 

### This Fall

I’m hoping to work towards getting my drivers license, so prayers for that as well! I desire to find times to have other families over and invite them into our home. Sometimes that can be challenging for us so prayers on discernment for that. 


As we move into fall, we are praising God for what He has done and looking forward to what He will do this year. Thank you for your prayers.
