![](images/house.jpg)After an impromptu day trip to Dallas, all documents have been submitted to the Japanese government! This is an exciting moment for us. With the kids in preschool/daycare full time, Emma has time available to devote to language learning. Stewart's job is searching for a replacement and he's assisting in this process. Judah asks a myriad of questions about Japan. A most pressing question, presented with significant urgency: "There is construction equipment in Japan, right?" To his utter joy, the answer was yes. His 4-year-old heart is speaking to us; it's such an insight into what matters to him. We are thankful he can voice these questions!

Japan has been on the radar for most of our marriage. Waiting is something that Stewart and I have gotten much more used to over the years. However, "used to doesn't necessarily mean"better at". You'd think we'd be like so good at waiting, but nawww. At times, it has felt as if God disappears from our sight. Just when we'd turn a bend on an unfamiliar road, it was that settling feeling of seeing that grocery store you recognize and saying, "oh yes...wait yeah yeah yeah I know where I am now". So, with that same God, we wait. Wow! What a privilege. Thank you for your prayers!
