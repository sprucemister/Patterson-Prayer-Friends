## Prayer requests

- New schools for the boys and adjusting for everyone (including mom and dad!)
- Some relationships have shown more interest in discussing spiritual things. Praying for discernment in a culture not our own.
- Language learning for Emma  (who is hoping to have more time to devote to since both kiddos will be in school now)

We moved! It has been almost two months since we moved! Boxes are all unpacked and the home is meeting our needs. We are deeply thankful for this home and I am looking forward to inviting many for dinner around our much bigger kitchen table!

Next month, Judah starts first grade at our local Japanese elementary school and Solomon starts at Japanese kindergarten. It feels very momentous and I can’t believe we are already here.

## Retreating In the mountains

This past weekend we went on a retreat with our missionary organization in Karuizawa, Japan. The kids enjoyed running around the woods and we all enjoyed the fellowship!

I’ve been wrestling with identity. When you move to another culture you inevitably change to adjust to the culture. I’ve been struggling with fear of not knowing what I will be like after more time in Japan. I fear I will be less understood by others or even myself. The retreat allowed me to process this more and God reminded me that I am being transformed by Him and under his wing no matter what. 

> Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit - 

**Psalm 51:10-12**

## Sakura Spring

Sakura are beginning to bloom as I write this. I observe that many Japanese seem to enjoy watching the progression of the bud. I’ve seen so many people stop and observe the tiny buds and discuss with one another about it.

Then, when they begin to bloom they stop again to enjoy, take pictures or picnic under the blooms.

What’s funny is I enjoy watching them observe the tree—so much of Tokyo is harried and hurried. I love seeing something that slows people down, even for a moment.

Personally, it’s a reminder to stop and enjoy the anticipation of something.
Appreciate the progress, not just the end result. May we await for Easter Sunday with anticipation this year.

We love you guys, and would love to hear what your Easter season looks like this year. Feel free to write any time.
