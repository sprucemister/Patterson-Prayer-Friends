Prayer requests: 

- The new school year and change 

- That Emma can find sustainable language study rhythms and enjoyment in language learning 

- For our upcoming trips 

- For a car that fits our family

Thank you for your responses to our previous newsletter. It really encourages and lifts us up to hear about what is going on in your lives and how you are praying!

Judah finished his first school year. Normally, I would be excited for a new school year starting in April; However, I find myself reflective and hesitant. This year has been so much change. I felt I was just starting to enjoy the consistency and making connections with the moms in his class. I'm allowing myself to grieve and reminding myself that we can embrace change again (it`s also the same school!). We are so proud of Judah, wow what a year. Please pray for us as we continue to support him.

I (Emma) have decided to quit formal language school. Continuing on, I will be doing self-study and private lessons during the week. I'm excited to continue my studies and implement more of my goals in language acquisition.

I (Stewart) am enjoying lots of tennis, making new friends and adjusting to the work culture at my new job.

We are excited as we look at the year ahead to plan trips around Japan to meet with other missionaries. We are prayerfully discerning where God would have us here.

A few weekends ago, we spent some time with Jim and Masako participating in a Bible study with other local believers. We reflected on Matthew 11:28-30.

*Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. \[29\] Take myÂ yokeÂ upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. \[30\] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.*

Wherever this finds you today I hope it blesses you. These words are meant for you and for me. They ring true around the world, let's delight in that today! We are praying for you, if you feel so inclined please email us with ways we can pray for you.
