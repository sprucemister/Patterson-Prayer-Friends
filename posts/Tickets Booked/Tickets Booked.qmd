Quick update from Emma Claire on the Pattersons' move to Japan: we have booked one-way tickets for Japan for June 15!

We’ve been testing out new Japanese dinner ideas to get ready for Japanese life. 
Solomon is a big fan of onigiri with azuki bean and Judah likes a plain old rice ball.

We are getting closer to launch day, and lasts are becoming more frequent. The house is on the market and Stewart and I are wrapping things up at work. We aren’t buying the big ketchup at the store. And there are many to-do lists going on currently. 

Stewart is part of a bible study virtually in Japan. One of the members recently got baptized. This made us so happy!



## Goodbye Party

Our friends in OKC threw us a goodbye party. It was filled with love and joy. I looked around and thought about how we didn’t know any of these friends 7 years ago! Wow. God created a beautiful community for us in OKC. That’s an encouragement as we pray for community in Japan.

We are finding ourselves really thankful for all the supportive people in our lives. What an encouragement you guys have been. I find myself treasuring typical “how’s the weather” conversations, knowing they will be much more limited. You don’t realize the beauty of those ordinary things sometimes.

::: {.callout-note}
**Prayers**: I (Emma) have spoken to many coworkers about the move as people are generally really interested when you are moving so far away! Many opportunities to talk about what God is doing in our lives. Please pray for these conversations.

Stay tuned for our next update which will (God willing) be from Japan!
